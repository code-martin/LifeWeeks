# Life in Weeks (by Months)

A minimalist, printable visualizer of a human lifespan broken down by months and weeks — inspired by the idea of measuring life visually.

## Overview

This web application allows you to:

- Input a date of birth and a current date.
- Generate a life calendar showing 90 years, each split into 12 months and 4 weeks per month.
- Visually track time passed by highlighting filled cells from birth to the selected current date.

Useful for personal reflection, habit tracking, or as a printable life calendar.

## Features

- Simple, responsive design.
- No dependencies — pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Printable layout with non-essential elements hidden on print.
- Color-coded cells to show elapsed time.

## Usage

1. Open the HTML file in a browser.
2. Enter your birth date.
3. Optionally adjust the current date (defaults to today).
4. Click **Generate Table**.
5. The table will display 90 years, each with 48 weeks (4 weeks per month), and highlight the elapsed time.

## Notes

- Each cell represents approximately one week.
- Months are simplified to always show 4 weeks for visual clarity.
- To print, use your browser’s print feature — interface elements are hidden automatically.
